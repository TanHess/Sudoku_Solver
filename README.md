# Sudoku Solver 
## (For even the toughest of puzzles)

This is a basic sudoku puzzle solver. The goal is to create a basis for loading sudoku puzzles that the program can then solve and print the result. 

I am personally a big fan of sudoku, specifically, sudokus more colorful twin, colorku. I have been playing for roughly 10 years now and wanted to develop a program to solve even the most complicated of puzzles. 

Although I love the challenge of puzzle solving and coding, this is my first attempt at a project of this scale on my own. 

This project is largely based on and worked out with the aid of the article by Lior Sinai on this same topic.
